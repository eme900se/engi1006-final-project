This is a website for my ENGI1006 final project using a Flask server.

--I used a css template from a website I created a while ago using bootstrap. I'm currently making a website portfolio so I used this assignment to work on that.
--I only have 3 pages at the moment: home, baking and cakes. The rest I'm working on/not uploading for this project. 
	--> You can get to baking from the navbar or through the home page.
	--> You can only get to the cakes page from the baking page picture link.
